# Snake Game üêç in C

This is a Snake game made with the NCURSES library. It's a cool little project I did for fun, especially after spending too much time with high-level programming at work. Sometimes, it's just nice to get back to basics and code something simple and entertaining.

Check out the [NCURSES Programming HOWTO](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/index.html) if you want to try something like this too.

It's all about having a bit of fun with C and remembering what it's like to build something cool from the ground up. Enjoy playing and maybe coding your own version!
